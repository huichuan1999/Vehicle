0.64,0.6,0.3,0.25,5,"NOAA weather satellites are polar-orbiting satellites developed by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They are designed to monitor Earth's climate and environment and provide high-resolution images of Earth's weather patterns from space. The satellite will circle the Earth from North Pole to South Pole 14 times a day, enabling full global coverage every 12 hours.",enFont,#fff,28,128000,50,1,A
0.64,0.6,0.3,0.25,5,"Weather satellites work like radio systems. The polar-orbiting satellite takes images while it moves over the Earth, broadcasting data back to the ground. Tuning into specific satellite frequencies, ground stations can receive and decode analogue signals.",enFont,#fff,28,170000,50,1,A 
0.64,0.6,0.3,0.25,5,"The NOAA-15 weather satellite (the oldest satellite we have been receiving signals from) launched on May 13, 1998. NOAA-15's mission was to be in space for only 2 years, but it has been circling the Earth in a sun-synchronous orbit for over 23 years.",enFont,#fff,28,195000,50,1,A 
0.6,0.25,0.3,0.25,5,"The first successful Low Earth Orbit weather satellite, TIROS-1, entered orbit on April 1, 1960. Despite plans for a mission duration of 90 days, TIROS-1 lost contact with the ground station on June 15th, 1960, due to an electrical power failure.",enFont,#fff,25,360000,55,1,A
0.4,0.2,0.3,0.25,5,"Over its short lifespan of 75 days, TIROS-1 captured and transmitted 23,000 photos back to Earth.",enFont,#fff,25,385000,55,1,A
0.2,0.2,0.3,0.25,5,"In this process, the position of the satellite determines not only the image but also the satellite's broadcasting coverage.",enFont,#fff,25,405000,55,1,A
0.5,0.2,0.3,0.25,5,"For the first time, it was possible to observe cloud formations and meteorological patterns at a large scale.",enFont,#fff,25,420000,55,1,A
